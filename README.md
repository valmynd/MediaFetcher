Tool to play and download media from various sources - e.g. Youtube, Myspace, Sharehosters, etc.

Roadmap
=======

- Phase 1: Create a GUI for [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/)
- Phase 2: Include Public Broadcasting as seen in [MediathekView](http://zdfmediathk.sourceforge.net/)
- Phase 3: Integrate Media Player, comparable to [Minitube](http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube)
- Phase 4: Add Support for Sharehosters and DLC-Containers


There is nothing to see yet, currently it is just a playground and I don't know if I will find the
time to bring this forward.

Alternatives
============

- [YouTube-Downloader](http://portablelinuxapps.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=343)
- [GYD](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gyd/)
